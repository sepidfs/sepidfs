## About Me! 👋

I am a data analyst with a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Statistical Analysis. I have more than five years of experience working with complex datasets, building analytical dashboards, developing end-to-end data pipelines, and applying modern ML techniques such as neural networks to real business problems.

I have hands-on expertise in Python, R, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cloud platforms including Azure and AWS, as well as Big Data tools. I enjoy transforming raw data into clear and meaningful insights that support strategic decisions.

I am passionate about analytical problem-solving, workflow automation, and using data, machine learning, and cloud technologies to drive measurable impact.
